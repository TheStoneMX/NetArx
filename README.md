### Web Application Requirements Document for Deepfake Detection System

---

## 1. **Project Overview**
This document outlines the requirements for developing a web application that detects deepfake videos using biometric signals extracted from facial videos. The system will leverage remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and attention mechanisms to accurately differentiate between real and fake faces.

---

## 2. **Objectives**
- Develop a web-based platform to detect deepfakes using biometric signal analysis.
- Extract rPPG signals from uploaded videos, analyze them in the time and frequency domains, and visualize results using Matrix Visualization Heatmaps (MVHM).
- Utilize a machine learning model (VGG19 with attention mechanism) for classifying the videos as real or fake.
- Provide users with a user-friendly interface to upload videos, visualize analysis results, and download reports.

---

## 3. **Scope**
The application will:
- Support video uploads in common formats (MP4, AVI, etc.).
- Extract rPPG signals from facial regions in the uploaded videos.
- Analyze these signals using FFT and visualize the results in a heatmap.
- Classify the video as real or fake using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Provide downloadable reports summarizing the detection results.

## 4. **System Requirements**

### 4.1 **Functional Requirements**

#### 4.1.1 **User Interface**
- The user should be able to log in and register an account.
- The user should be able to upload videos for analysis.
- The system should display progress and status during video processing.
- The system should show the results, including heatmaps and classification outputs.
- The user should be able to download a report containing the detection results.

#### 4.1.2 **Video Upload and Preprocessing**
- Accept video files up to a specified size (e.g., 200MB).
- Validate video format and resolution.
- Perform face detection and extract Regions of Interest (ROIs) using dlib's facial landmark detection.
- Extract rPPG signals from multiple ROIs using the Chrom method.
- Preprocess rPPG signals to remove noise (sliding window detrending and Butterworth band-pass filtering).

#### 4.1.3 **Time-Frequency Analysis**
- Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the rPPG signals to generate time-frequency domain matrices.
- Generate Matrix Visualization Heatmaps (MVHM) for classification.

#### 4.1.4 **Deepfake Detection**
- Use a pre-trained VGG19 model with a spatial attention mechanism to classify videos as real or fake.
- Display detection results, including confidence scores and heatmaps, on the web interface.
- Store results in a database for future reference.

#### 4.1.5 **Reporting**
- Generate downloadable PDF reports summarizing the analysis, including:
  - Video filename and upload date.
  - Heatmap visualizations.
  - Classification results with confidence scores.

### 4.2 **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### 4.2.1 **Performance**
- The system should be able to process a 3-second video in under 30 seconds.
- Ensure that the application can handle concurrent uploads by multiple users.

#### 4.2.2 **Scalability**
- The system should be scalable to handle increased traffic and storage as the user base grows.
- Cloud integration (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalable storage and processing.

#### 4.2.3 **Security**
- Implement secure user authentication (OAuth2).
- Store sensitive user data and results securely using encryption.
- Ensure that video files are deleted from the server after processing to protect user privacy.

#### 4.2.4 **Usability**
- The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- Provide clear instructions for uploading videos and interpreting results.
